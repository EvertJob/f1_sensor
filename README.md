# F1 Sensor for Home Assistant
![GitHub release (latest)](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/Nicxe/f1_sensor)
![HACS Custom](https://img.shields.io/badge/HACS-Custom-blue)

## What is F1 Sensor?

This is a custom integration for Home Assistant that creates sensors using data from the [Jolpica-F1 API](https://github.com/jolpica/jolpica-f1). It is designed for users who want to build automations, scripts, notifications, TTS messages, or more advanced use cases such as generating dynamic dashboards, triggering race-day routines, syncing events to calendars, or integrating with external services based on upcoming Formula 1 events.


> [!TIP]
> If your goal is to visually display upcoming race information, current standings, > and more in your Home Assistant dashboard, the [FormulaOne Card](https://github.com/marcokreeft87/formulaone-card) is the better choice for that purpose.



This integration **does not provide any UI components**. Instead, it creates:
- `sensor.f1_next_race` — Attributes include detailed information about the next race, such as when and where it takes place.
- `sensor.f1_season_calendar` — A list of all races in the current F1 season.
- `sensor.f1_driver_standings` — Current driver championship standings.
- `sensor.f1_constructor_standings` — Current constructor championship standings.
- `sensor.f1_weather`: Current weather and race-time forecast at the next race location.


During installation, you can choose exactly which sensors you want to include in your setup.  
This gives you control over which data points to load — for example, only the next race and weather, without standings or calendar.

You can always change this selection later by reconfiguring the integration via **Settings > Devices & Services** in Home Assistant.


The integration fetches fresh data from the Jolpica-F1 API every 1 hours.


I personally use this integration to display the next race and the following three races on an e-ink display. You can read more about that setup [here](https://github.com/Nicxe/esphome).




## Installation

You can install this integration as a custom repository by following one of these guides:

### With HACS (Recommended)

To install the custom component using HACS:

1. Click on the three dots in the top right corner of the HACS overview menu.
2. Select **Custom repositories**.
3. Add the repository URL: `https://github.com/Nicxe/f1_sensor`.
4. Select type: **Integration**.
5. Click the **ADD** button.

<details>
<summary>Without HACS</summary>

1. Download the latest release of the F1 Sensor integration from **[GitHub Releases](https://github.com/Nicxe/f1_sensor/releases)**.
2. Extract the downloaded files and place the `f1_sensor` folder in your Home Assistant `custom_components` directory (usually located in the `config/custom_components` directory).
3. Restart your Home Assistant instance to load the new integration.

## Configuration

To add the integration to your Home Assistant instance, use the button below:

<p>
    <a href="https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/config_flow_start?domain=f1_sensor" class="my badge" target="_blank">
        <img src="https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/config_flow_start.svg">
    </a>
</p>



### Manual Configuration

If the button above does not work, you can also perform the following steps manually:

1. Browse to your Home Assistant instance.
2. Go to **Settings > Devices & Services**.
3. In the bottom right corner, select the **Add Integration** button.
4. From the list, select **F1 Sensor**.
5. Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the setup.

## Available Sensors

This integration provides the following sensors:

- `sensor.f1_next_race`: Details about the upcoming race.

- `sensor.f1_driver_standings`: Current driver championship standings.
- `sensor.f1_constructor_standings`: Current constructor championship standings.
- `sensor.f1_weather`: Current weather and race-time forecast at the next race location.

### Sensor Attributes Reference

This integration provides several sensors with rich attribute data. Below is a reference guide for what attributes are available in each sensor, including examples of how to access them in templates.

#### Example usage in template

Get info about the first race in the calendar:

```jinja
{% set races = state_attr('sensor.f1_current_season', 'races') %}
Next race: {{ races[0].raceName }} at {{ races[0].Circuit.circuitName }} in {{ races[0].Circuit.Location.locality }}
```
</details>

<details>
<summary>sensor.f1_weather</summary>

The `sensor.f1_weather` sensor provides weather data for the location of the next Formula 1 race, powered by [MET Norway](https://www.met.no).

It includes:
- **Current weather** at the circuit (`current_` attributes).
- **Forecasted weather** for the scheduled race start time (`race_` attributes).

> [!NOTE]
> Weather forecasts are available up to 9 days in advance. The closer we get to race day, the more frequent and precise the forecast becomes (up to hourly resolution). If the race is more than 9 days away, the `race_` attributes will have a value of `null`.
</details>



## Example

### Example Screenshots

This [e-ink display project](https://github.com/Nicxe/esphome) uses the sensors from this integration to show upcoming Formula 1 races, including race countdown and schedule.

### Example: Announce next race and top standings via TTS

You can use this integration to generate a TTS message that announces how many days remain until the next race, along with the top 3 drivers and constructors.

#### Example automation / script using `tts.google_translate_say`

```yaml
service: tts.google_translate_say
data:
  entity_id: media_player.living_room_speaker
  message: >
    {% set next_race = state_attr('sensor.f1_next_race', 'race_name') %}
    {% set race_date = as_datetime(state_attr('sensor.f1_next_race', 'race_start')) %}
    {% set race_location = state_attr('sensor.f1_next_race', 'circuit_locality') %}
    {% set race_country = state_attr('sensor.f1_next_race', 'circuit_country') %}
    {% set days_left = (race_date.date() - now().date()).days %}
    {% set drivers = state_attr('sensor.f1_driver_standings', 'driver_standings') %}
    {% set constructors = state_attr('sensor.f1_constructor_standings', 'constructor_standings') %}

    The next Formula 1 race is the {{ next_race }} in {{ race_location }}, {{ race_country }}, happening in {{ days_left }} day{{ 's' if days_left != 1 else '' }}.

    The top 3 drivers right now are:
    Number 1: {{ drivers[0].Driver.givenName }} {{ drivers[0].Driver.familyName }} with {{ drivers[0].points }} points.
    Number 2: {{ drivers[1].Driver.givenName }} {{ drivers[1].Driver.familyName }} with {{ drivers[1].points }} points.
    Number 3: {{ drivers[2].Driver.givenName }} {{ drivers[2].Driver.familyName }} with {{ drivers[2].points }} points.

    In the constructor standings:
    Number 1: {{ constructors[0].Constructor.name }} with {{ constructors[0].points }} points.
    Number 2: {{ constructors[1].Constructor.name }} with {{ constructors[1].points }} points.
    Number 3: {{ constructors[2].Constructor.name }} with {{ constructors[2].points }} points.
```

---

### Example: Mobile notification with race info and standings

You can also send the same data as a mobile notification using notify.mobile_app_*:

#### Example using `notify.mobile_app_yourdevice`

```yaml
service: notify.mobile_app_yourdevice
data:
  title: "🏁 Formula 1 Update"
  message: >
    {% set race = state_attr('sensor.f1_next_race', 'race_name') %}
    {% set city = state_attr('sensor.f1_next_race', 'circuit_locality') %}
    {% set country = state_attr('sensor.f1_next_race', 'circuit_country') %}
    {% set race_time = as_datetime(state_attr('sensor.f1_next_race', 'race_start')) %}
    {% set days = (race_time.date() - now().date()).days %}
    {% set drivers = state_attr('sensor.f1_driver_standings', 'driver_standings') %}
    {% set constructors = state_attr('sensor.f1_constructor_standings', 'constructor_standings') %}
    Next race: {{ race }} in {{ city }}, {{ country }} — in {{ days }} day{{ 's' if days != 1 else '' }}.

    Top drivers:
    1. {{ drivers[0].Driver.familyName }} ({{ drivers[0].points }} pts)
    2. {{ drivers[1].Driver.familyName }} ({{ drivers[1].points }} pts)
    3. {{ drivers[2].Driver.familyName }} ({{ drivers[2].points }} pts)

    Top constructors:
    1. {{ constructors[0].Constructor.name }} ({{ constructors[0].points }} pts)
    2. {{ constructors[1].Constructor.name }} ({{ constructors[1].points }} pts)
    3. {{ constructors[2].Constructor.name }} ({{ constructors[2].points }} pts)
```
