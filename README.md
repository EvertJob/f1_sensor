# F1 Sensor


### What is this integration?

This is a custom integration for Home Assistant that creates sensors using data from the [Jolpica-F1 API](https://github.com/jolpica/jolpica-f1). It is designed for users who want to build automations, scripts, notifications, TTS messages, or more advanced use cases such as generating dynamic dashboards, triggering race-day routines, syncing events to calendars, or integrating with external services based on upcoming Formula 1 events.


> [!TIP]
> If your goal is to *visually display* upcoming race information, current standings, and more in your Home Assistant dashboard, the [FormulaOne Card](https://github.com/marcokreeft87/formulaone-card) is the better choice for that purpose.


This integration **does not provide any UI components**. Instead, it creates:
- `sensor.f1_next_race` — Attributes include detailed information about the next race, such as when and where it takes place.
- `sensor.f1_season_calendar` — A list of all races in the current F1 season.

I personally use this integration to display the next race and the following three races on an e-ink display. You can read more about that setup [here](https://github.com/Nicxe/esphome).
